**DroidScripts** is a project that groups different scripts that I made for solving problems during a CTF or helping in a different phases for an application penetration test.

* *extract-dir*: extract the private directory of a specified application.
* *smali2human*: tool to extract information about the Smali files (methods, fields, libraries, ...).
* *logall*: put logs in every class to trace the application execution.
* *sqlite2human*: generate a static HTML page with the SQLite data in a Datatables (TODO: different types of output JSON, CVS, ...)
